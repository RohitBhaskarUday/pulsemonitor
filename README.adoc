= Pulse Monitor

image:https://img.shields.io/badge/vert.x-4.5.14-purple.svg[link="https://vertx.io"]

This application was built using http://start.vertx.io and extended to create a **URL Latency Monitoring Service**.

Pulse Monitor was built to explore **asynchronous backend architectures** and **non-blocking event loops** using Vert.x.

This is a lightweight service that could:
- Periodically monitor the **latency** and **availability** of multiple URLs without blocking threads.
- Persist monitoring data for analysis and uptime tracking.
- Handle high concurrency efficiently using **Vert.x‚Äôs event-driven model**.
- Provide simple REST APIs for interaction without the need for a complex frontend.

== Requirements

- Java 17+
- Maven 3.6+
- Postman/Hoppscotch/Httpie

== Persistence

- H2 file-based embedded database is used for storing URLs and historical check results.
- Database is created automatically; no external setup needed.


== Building

To launch your tests:
```
./mvnw clean install
```
To make changes execute your application:
```
./mvnw exec:java
```
To Run the application:
```
./start.sh
```

== How It Works After Starting

- Server runs at: `http://localhost:8888`
- Scheduled latency checks happen every 10 seconds.
- New URLs can be added dynamically via POST `/monitor`.
- Monitoring data is saved automatically to H2 database.


== Available Endpoints

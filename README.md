# pulsemonitor
Pulse Monitor is a backend application built using Vert.x that tracks the latency and uptime of URLs asynchronously. It uses event-driven, non-blocking architecture to monitor multiple endpoints efficiently, persist results into a file-based H2 database, and expose a simple REST API for adding, listing, and deleting monitored URLs.
